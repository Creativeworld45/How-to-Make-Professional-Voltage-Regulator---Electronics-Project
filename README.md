Do you thinking about making a professional voltage regulating circuit. Then this project is for you. Following this project, you can easily make a professional voltage regulating circuit at home easily. It is a very cheap, useful and simple electronics project that you can make at home easily without any risk.
To make this simple project, you might need some electronics project. These component list have to been given below.


Component list :  

1. Timer IC – NE 555
2. Mosfet – IRF 840
3. Ceramic Capacitor – 102k /2kv
                       104
4. Capacitor – 2.2µf/ 50v
5. Resistor – 1 KΩ
                   10 KΩ
6. LED – 5mm (5 Pieces)
7. Signal Diode – 1N 4148 (2 Pieces)
8. Volume – B 100K
9. Power Supply – DC 12v


Mosfet & Volume Pinout – 


IRF 840 is an N-channel MOSFET. The MOSFET contains 3 legs. These 3 legs have different names. If you count from left this, then 1st the leg is “Gate”, 2nd leg is “Drain” & 3rd leg is “Source”.
As like the MOSFET, the volume/potentiometer also have 3 legs. These 3 legs also have 3 different names. Then if we count from the left side, its 1st leg is “Ground”, 2nd leg is “Output” & 3rd leg is “Input”.


Circuit connection – 


1st we connect 4 no leg with 8 no leg and 2 no leg with 6 no leg of timer IC.
Now we connect “Gate” with 7 no leg of timer IC. Then connect capacitor negative leg with “Source” of MOSFET. Now we connect 102k/2kv ceramic capacitor. Connect a ceramic capacitor with 5 no leg of timer IC and another terminal with “Source” leg of MOSFET.
Now we connect 10 KΩ resistors with the “Gate” leg of MOSFET. Then connect a connector with the empty terminal of 10 KΩ resistors, positive leg of 2.2µf/50v capacitor & 8no leg of timer IC.

Connect timer IC 1 no leg with “Source” leg of MOSFET. Then connect 104 ceramic capacitors with 1 and 2 no leg of timer IC.
To regulate the circuit, now we make the connection of volume. Now we connect signal diode negative leg with “Input” leg of volume. Then connect another signal diode positive leg with the “Ground” leg of volume. Now connect both signal diode empty terminal. Now connect 2 cables with volume. 1 cable with “Output” leg of volume & another cable with the joint place of both signal diode.

The cable is connected with the joint place of both signal diode, we connect that cable with 2 no leg of timer IC. And the cable is connected with the “Output” leg of volume, we connect that cable with 3 no leg of timer IC.

 Using 4 pieces 5 mm LED we make a series connection & then the LED light will glow with DC-12v. We connect LED positive leg with  8 no leg of timer IC and LED negative leg with “Drain” leg of MOSFET.
 
Now connect 1 KΩ resistor with 8 no leg of timer IC & connect 5 mm LED positive leg with an empty terminal with 1 KΩ resistor and LED negative leg with 1 no leg of timer IC.



For power source we are using DC-12v. Connect DC positive cable with 8 no leg of timer IC and DC negative cable with 1 no leg of timer IC.
Our circuit is ready for use now. Just plug-in power & enjoy the circuit.
